Kotlin is in itself a polyglot language. It brings together the powerful capabilities from many different languages.

**Multi paradigm programming language:** You may write plain scripts in Kotlin, write object-oriented code, functional style code, program asynchronously, and more.

**Multi purpose programming language:** Server-side, mobile/Android, and front-end development, hence can be used for full stack development. kotlin-jvm converts kotlin code to byte codes which can be run on any virtial machine. 

**Statically typed programming language:** Type checking occurs at compile time

**REPL in Kotlin:** read-evaluate-print loop. command-line shell to run small snippets of code, like we do in python.
